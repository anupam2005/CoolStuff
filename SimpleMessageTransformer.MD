Okay, here is a user story with acceptance criteria designed for a new joiner to get familiar with Spring Boot, Gradle, Apache ActiveMQ, and Apache Camel, acting as a Principle Engineer guiding their initial task.

User Story: Implement a Simple Message Transformer
As a new member of the engineering team,
I want to build a basic Spring Boot application that receives a text message, appends the current date, and sends it to another destination
so that I can learn the fundamentals of integrating Spring Boot, Apache Camel, and Apache ActiveMQ.

Description:

This story is designed to get you acquainted with the core technologies we use for message processing. You will create a Spring Boot application that acts as a simple message transformer. It will listen for messages on an ActiveMQ queue, process them by adding a timestamp, and then forward the modified message to a different ActiveMQ queue. The application should be built using Gradle and leverage Apache Camel for routing and transformation. A key part of this task is ensuring good test coverage to understand how we build reliable systems.

Acceptance Criteria:

Application Setup:

Given I have a local development environment configured with Java, Gradle, and Docker (or a local ActiveMQ instance).
When I clone the provided application template or create a new Spring Boot project using start.spring.io with the necessary dependencies (Spring Boot, ActiveMQ, Camel Spring Boot starter).
Then I can build the application successfully using ./gradlew build.
Message Reception:

Given the application is running and connected to an ActiveMQ broker.
When a text message is sent to a configurable input ActiveMQ queue (e.g., input.queue).
Then the application should receive the message.
Message Transformation:

Given the application has received a text message.
When the message is processed by the Camel route.
Then the current date and time in a consistent format (e.g., yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss) should be appended to the original message body. For example, "Hello" becomes "Hello [current_date_time]".
Message Sending:

Given the message has been successfully transformed with the appended date.
When the Camel route finishes processing.
Then the modified message should be sent to a configurable output ActiveMQ queue (e.g., output.queue).
Technology Usage:

Given the application is implemented.
When examining the codebase.
Then it should clearly demonstrate the use of:
Spring Boot for application context and configuration.
Gradle for dependency management and building.
Apache ActiveMQ as the message broker for both input and output queues.
Apache Camel for defining the message route from input to output, including the transformation step.
Test Coverage:

Given the application code is written.
When running the test suite using ./gradlew test.
Then the code coverage report should indicate at least 80% overall line coverage. This should include tests for the Camel route logic and message transformation.
Code Quality and Structure:

Given the implementation is complete.
When reviewing the code.
Then the code should be well-organized, follow standard Spring Boot and Java conventions, and include meaningful comments where necessary.
Learning Objectives (Self-Assessment):

Given the story is completed.
When reflecting on the process.
Then I should be able to explain:
How Spring Boot simplifies application setup and configuration.
How Apache ActiveMQ is used for asynchronous messaging.
How Apache Camel routes define message flows and enable transformations.
How to write tests for Camel routes within a Spring Boot application.
Guidance for the New Joiner:

Start by setting up a basic Spring Boot project with the required dependencies. start.spring.io is a great resource.
You'll need an ActiveMQ broker running. You can use a Docker image (activemq) for this easily.
Explore the Apache Camel Spring Boot documentation. You'll define your route in a class that extends RouteBuilder.
Focus on getting the basic message flow working first, then add the date transformation.
Writing tests as you go will help you understand how the different components interact and ensure your logic is correct. Look into camel-test-spring for testing Camel routes in a Spring Boot context.
Don't hesitate to ask questions if you get stuck!
